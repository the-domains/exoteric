# hustle & flow

spent the day @hustlecon in oakland. 

perhaps it is my old age, startup bubble fatigue or just plain grumpiness that I am trying to combat, but was hoping that the stellar group of speakers could break my funk and help propel my contemplated leap back into the wild world of startups.

after watching great talks from some hyper-successful hustlers I came to the conclusion that while i am pretty sure that timing is what separates successes from failures - passion, persistence and vision are needed values for founders. 

I found the talk from Rich and Andy @headspace particularly inspiring. The two founders have brought a true passion in teaching the value of meditation to the masses and have kept their core values at the center of a rapidly expanding business. 

thanks @hustlecon for helping to get me back in the groove. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ec795dcb-9dae-4c5a-86a8-cce818c1d153.jpg)
